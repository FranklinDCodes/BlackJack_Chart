Here is how the betting function works

It works in intervals that start as intervals of 100 (i = 100), and the logarithmically increase.
So for example, at first it bets using all money under 100$.
The P parameter determines how much of that money to use for each bet, e.g. 0.08 means 8% of it.
Once it gets to 103$ for example, the new betting interval is from 100-200$.
Now the bet amount will be used by multiplying P by all cash over 100$.
So if you have 102$ and P = 0.08, you will bet (2)(0.08) or $0.16.
If the balance should happen to land on a space precisely between two intervals,
lets say $100.00 even, or the bet is unreasonably small, the bet will bet determined by the minimum value M.
Lets say in this case the balance is $100, M = 1 then the bet will be 1$
Eventually after betting for a while, the betting interval will increase.
Maybe by the time you get to 1000$, you can now bet all the free cash between 1000-2000$, then 2000-3000$ ...
i will increase at a steady rate.
Maybe the function will be such that i increases every time 10 intervals are completed.

This is how the betting function works.
